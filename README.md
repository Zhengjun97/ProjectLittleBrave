# Project4900

## Overview
This project is a web-based 2D game designed to provide players with an immersive and enjoyable experience. Players can explore a world scene, interact with NPCs, pick up items, and engage in boss battles. While the initial focus was on incorporating educational elements, such as quizzes to teach computer science and math skills, the project evolved into a more gameplay-focused experience due to time constraints. The game's vibrant world and interactive features aim to captivate players and make their journey entertaining.

## Key Features
- **World Exploration**: Players can control their character, interact with NPCs, and explore different parts of the game world.
- **Boss Battles**: Players participate in turn-based boss battles, where correct answers lead to attacks on the boss, and incorrect answers result in the player being attacked.
- **Interactive Dialogue**: Players engage in conversations with NPCs before entering battle scenes, making the experience more immersive.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Framework**: Phaser JS
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Kenney assets, Visual Studio Code

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project directory and launch the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## Future Plans
- Improve the world scene with more interactive NPCs and environments.
- Implement transitions between world exploration and battle scenes.
- Add more complex boss battle mechanics and visual effects.
- Integrate advanced progress tracking and analytics to help players monitor their learning progress.
